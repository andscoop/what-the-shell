# what-the-shell
Go likes tight packages that do few things very well. This package does one thing, tells you your shell.

Inspired by simplicity of [go-homedir](https://github.com/mitchellh/go-homedir)

## TODO
- check for non-default configuration by parsing [RUNCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_commands) files
- add more shells
- testing
